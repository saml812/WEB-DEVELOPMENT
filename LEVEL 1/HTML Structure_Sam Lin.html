				The Great Divde
			</h4>
			<p>
				In the world of web programming, there was once conflict, The burden of grouping text was left to the <span>monkeys</span> where skills in such areas were so lacking that they could do little more than press the <b><i>Enter</i></b> key over and over again.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then there came the <span>DIV</span> and the <span>SPAN</span>. Lo these mighty tags brought peace to the realm and the <span>monkeys</span> lived happily ever after.

				This text is a complete fabrication and utter nonsense. The management takes no responsibility for anyone who believes that any of this has any basis in fact.
